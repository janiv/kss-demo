# Using KSS to create Dynamic Styleguides

This is a demo project to go along with my talk on how to use KSS (specficially the PHP version) to
create dynamic styleguides.

I've tagged each step of the process so people can easily follow along with what's changing at each
step. Feel free to review the diffs of each tag to see what's changing in each step.

Also, if you're using Symfony and KSS, checkout http://github.com/scaninc/ScanKssBundle.
